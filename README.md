## Sleeping in the Forest<br />
<br />
I thought the earth remembered me,<br />
she took me back so tenderly,<br />
arranging her dark skirts, her pockets<br />
full of lichens and seeds.<br />
I slept as never before, a stone on the river bed,<br />
nothing between me and the white fire of the stars<br />
but my thoughts, and they floated light as moths<br />
among the branches of the perfect trees.<br />
All night I heard the small kingdoms<br />
breathing around me, the insects,<br />
and the birds who do their work in the darkness.<br />
All night I rose and fell, as if in water,<br />
grappling with a luminous doom. By morning<br />
I had vanished at least a dozen times<br />
into something better.<br />
<br />
