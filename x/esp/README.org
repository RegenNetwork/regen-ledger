#+TITLE: ESP module

* Overview

The ESP (ecological state protocol) module provides a global geo-tagged, ledger of ecological health.

ESP's are managed by curating organizations (managed by the [[../agent/README.org][agent]] module) and can evolve through 
various versions as the curating organization refines its verification methodology. Curators are responsible for 
defining approved verifiers and a schema for ESP results.

All ESP results include a geo-polygon that allows the data stored in the ESP result registry to be projected onto a map
for visualization of global ecological health.

* Motivation and Rationale

* Transaction Messages and Types

* Identifiers
  ESP's are identified by the URI formed by taking the agent URI and appending ~/esp/<name>/<version>+<block-number>~.

* Indexing and Queries
